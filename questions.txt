1. Notice that main calls strcmp. What does it mean if strcmp, when passed two strings as arguments, returns 0?

The strings are the same.

2. How would you rewrite the line below, excerpted from main, using only if and else?
int max = (strcmp(g.level, "debug") == 0) ? 9 : 1024;

int max;
if (strcmp(g.level, "debug") == 0) {
    max = 9;
} else {
    max = 1024;
}

3. Under what circumstances might the call to sscanf below, excerpted from main, return 2 instead of 1?
sscanf(argv[2], " %d %c", &g.number, &c)

If the user entered in only one of the parameters.

4. What fields in g represent the coordinates at which the userâ€™s cursor belongs?

g.x represents mouse X
g.y represents mouse Y

5. What function (that we wrote) can you call to make the cursor actually appear at those coordinates? (Hint: we told you a little while back!)

Function show_cursor. It returns void.

6. Around what line number in main could you add additional case statements to handle keystrokes besides N, R, and ctrl-L?

Line 180, near the other conditional statements that test for certain character input.

7. Most n00b and l33t boards have lots of blanks. How many blanks are in debug #1? Debug #2? Debug #9? 

They all have the same amount of blanks.
